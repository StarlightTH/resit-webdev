                                <div  style="font-family:courier; font-weight: bold; margin-left:100px; margin-right:100px; font-size:150%;  padding-top: 30px;">The world of Mentality is heavily structured around mental issues and disorders, psychology, and moral questions.</p>
                              <p style="font-family:courier; font-size:100%; padding-top:10px ">The World Turtle of Mentality is set in the european continet, primarily in central and middle-western parts. 
                                In Mentality, during the cold war around the '60s, a meteor struck in northen Russia containing a violet pink spore that spread like a fog, consuming the terrain around it and reshaping it to how it saw fit. The trees become lungs which would animate when breathing, the ground would turn to flesh like substance resembling muscle tissue, and when standing within the fog, it would appear like TV static with the air bending like a plastic mirror inwards and outwards, bending the very world into something else. It was a long time before anyone noticed, it took it time getting used to to the environment, air pressure, seasons, and wind which all effected it's spread.  </p> 
                                <p style="font-family:courier; font-size:100%; font-weight: none; padding-top:10px ">Although having main characters the story is more about the people and how they react and act. The fogs effect without going into too much detail turns humans insane by going into their minds and looping their worst fears, mistakes, and overall twisting their perspective or reality. </p>
                                <p style="font-family:courier; font-size:100%; font-weight: none; padding-top:10px ">In the beginning, we follow Star, a 20-year-old regular man struggling with everyday life and his bad luck of always getting the short stick in life. When the fog spread to populated parts of the Asian continent the world noticed, and panic issued. NATO, along with other wordly powers did what they could to stop the spread but any interaction with the fog was lethal and unpredictable. </p>
                                <p style="font-family:courier; font-size:100%; font-weight: none; padding-top:10px ">NATO started recruiting people by the numbers, anyone who was fit to join. Star was one of those people. He began his 3-month training and after he finished, he was relocated back to his home country to assist in migration control due to knowing the languange and land. </p>
                                <p style="font-family:courier; font-size:100%; font-weight: none; padding-top:10px ">(From this point, I don't anything. Mostly bit and pieces of later events. But I hope this is somewhat interesting. Thank you for reading!)</p>
